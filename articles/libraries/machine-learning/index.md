# Introduction to the Quantum Machine Learning Library

The purpose of this documentation is to provide a concise introduction to machine learning tools (written in Q\#) for hybrid quantum/classical learning. We begin with a brief introduction to machine learning concepts and specifically their realization in quantum circuit centric classifiers. We then discuss the training and validation methods for such classifiers and how they map on specific Q\# operations provided by the library.
