# Quantum Circuits To Add Integers 

One of the basic tasks when it comes to building quantum circuit libraries for arithmetics is to bootstrap the functionality from simple building blocks. A useful building block are adders, i.e., the operation that takes two inputs $x$ and $y$, each represented on say $n$ bits, and produces the sum $x+y$ which in itself is an $n+1$ bit integers. There are several ways this can be accomplished on a quantum computer.

## Cuccaro-D...-K...-M... Adder

## Draper Adder
