# Quantum computing tour
Quantum computing is accessible now using the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit. The Q# programming language supports extensive and growing [research in quantum computing])http://www.vcpc.univie.ac.at/~ian/hotlist/qc/research.shtml). Q# syntax and logic gates work like other .NET languages in support of quantum algoritms.  

A classical program, implemented in Python or C#, serves as the host for Q# operations.  Quantum programs run on the [QuantumSimulator](..\machines\full-state-simulator.md) included with the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit.  Software designed using the Quantum Development Kit can interface with existing [quantum machines](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610250/serious-quantum-computers-are-finally-here-what-are-we-going-to-do-with-them/).
