# Bits and quibits
All classical computing information is stored and processed using bits and registers of bits. A bit can be in one of two states, which we typically represent as 0 or 1 (on or off). When measured or observed a quibit can only be in one of two states typically labeled |0> and |1>. But, quantum bit can also be in other states (like |+> or |->), which support the probability that the quibit will be 0 or 1. By default qubits are always on a |0> state.
