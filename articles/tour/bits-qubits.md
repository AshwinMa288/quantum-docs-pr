# Bits and quibits
In classical computing data is stored and processed using bits and registers of bits. A bit can be in one of two states, represented as 0 or 1. Quantum computing stores data using quibits. When measured or observed, a quibit is in one of two states, typically labeled |0> and |1>, but, a quantum bit can also be in other states (like |+> or |->). These nonbinary states support probabilities that the quibit will be 0 or 1.  Quantum proceessing can simultaneously model different possible configurations. These state may interfere with each other like waves in a tidepool.
