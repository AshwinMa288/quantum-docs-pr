# Linear algebra guide for quantum computing

This article introduces the linear algebra guide for quantum computing,
explaining why linear algebra is needed for quantum computing and what concepts
are essential.

One of the main purposes of the Quantum Development Kit is to provide a
high-level framework for quantum computing. This means that the user no longer
needs an advanced background of the low-level machinery behind quantum computing
to develop effective applications. However, some minimum background on linear
algebra is highly advisable for the user to capture the essence and the power of
quantum algorithms.

This guide is suitable for people with little to no background on linear algebra
that want to learn the basics needed to understand the essence behind most 
quantum algorithms as well for those who were once familiar with these concepts
but want to refresh the memory.

## Prerequisites

For this guide you must be familiar with the following concepts:

- Basic arithmetics with real numbers.

The following concepts are not essential to understand most of the guide but
will be used at some point:

- Basic concepts of trigonometric functions.
- Basic concepts of exponential functions and logarithms.

## Content of the guide

1. [Complex numbers for quantum computing](todo)
2. [Vectors in quantum computing](todo)
3. [Matrices and linear operations in quantum computing](todo)
4. [Tensor product in quantum computing](todo)
