# Develop with Q# and Binder

You can use Binder to run your Jupyter Notebooks online.

To configure Binder automatically and experiment with the QDK samples:

- Open a browser and run https://aka.ms/try-qsharp.

To configure Binder manually:

1. Go to [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org).
1. Fill out the fields, using *microsoft/quantum* as the GitHub URL.

Now that you have set up your Binder environment, you can write and run [your first quantum program](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstarts.qrng).
