uid: microsoft.quantum.targeting.requirescapability
name: RequiresCapability
type: newtype
namespace: microsoft.quantum.targeting
summary: |-
  Compiler-recognized attribute used to mark a callable with the runtime capabilities it
  requires.
remarks: |-
  This attribute is automatically added to callables by the compiler, unless an instance of
  this attribute already exists on the callable. It should not be used except in rare cases
  where the compiler does not infer the required capability correctly.

  Below is the list of capability level names, in order of increasing capabilities or
  decreasing restrictions:

  ## `"BasicQuantumFunctionality"`

  Measurement results cannot be compared for equality.

  ## `"BasicMeasurementFeedback"`

  Measurement results can be compared for equality only in if-statement conditional
  expressions in operations. The block of an if-statement that depends on a result cannot
  contain set statements for mutable variables declared outside the block, or return
  statements.

  ## `"FullComputation"`

  No runtime restrictions. Any Q# program can be executed.
syntax: newtype RequiresCapability = (String, String);
