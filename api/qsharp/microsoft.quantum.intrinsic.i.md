# I operation

Namespace: [Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic)

Package: [](https://nuget.org/packages/)


Performs the identity operation (no-op) on a single qubit.

```Q#
I (target : Qubit) : Unit
```


## Remarks

This is a no-op. It is provided for completeness and becausesometimes it is useful to call the identity in an algorithm or to pass it as a parameter.
